Built with React + Vite + node 20.10

To Run:

#### From command line

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### With docker

```
docker build -t prequin-frontend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 prequin-frontend
```

All pretty basic but things should work if you have the API running locally at the same time...
